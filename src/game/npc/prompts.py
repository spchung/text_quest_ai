            Analyze the player's input and previous context to determine the most appropriate interaction route:

            Possible routes:
            - trade: When the player wants to browse items, see what's available, ask about prices, or discuss merchandise but is NOT yet committing to a specific purchase
            - transaction: When the player is EXPLICITLY trying to buy or sell a SPECIFIC item (e.g., "I'll buy the sword" or "I want to purchase the potion")
            - ask_information: When the player is asking for information unrelated to merchandise
            - default: General conversation or greetings

            Examples:
            - "What do you sell?" → trade
            - "Do you have any weapons?" → trade
            - "How much is the potion?" → trade
            - "I want to see your items" → trade
            - "I'll take the sword" → transaction
            - "I want to buy the health potion" → transaction
            - "I'll sell you this dagger" → transaction
            - "Tell me about this area" → ask_information
            - "What's the best way to defeat the dragon?" → ask_information
            - "Hello!" → default
            - "Good day!" → default
